Android Basics Nanodegree Project 5

### Goal of the app
This app was created as an exercise for Android Basics Nanodegree at <a href="http://udacity.com">udacity.com</a>. The task was to create a tour guide application about a selected city. I chose Milan because I currently live there. The app consists of tabs displaying lists of four groups of tourist destinations:
- Sights
- Museums
- Restaurants
- Coffee houses

By clicking on a list item, you can reach the detail screen of a sight where you can find more information about the sight, how can you get there (GoogleMaps) and an audio guide for the sight. The app is accessible only in English.

Used technologies:
- Fragments
- ViewPager and FragmentPagerAdapter
- MediaPlayer and AudioManager
- Implicit intents
